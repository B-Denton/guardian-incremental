# guardian-incremental
Inspired by classic incremental games such as 'A Dark Room', I started a personal project to create an incremental game prototype, built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Titled "The Dragons' Guardian", this game sees you as a Guardian arriving on an ravaged island, seeking out Dragon Eggs that you can hatch and raise to start rebuilding the area.
Alongside raising your dragons, the game also implements a strategic combat system that players can use to explore the island and unlock progression elements.
